	<p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. As the brightest
		natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be visible to the naked eye
		in broad daylight.Venus' orbit is smaller than that of Earth, but its maximal elongation is 47°; thus, it can be
		seen not only near the Sun in the morning or evening, but also a couple of hours before or after sunrise or
		sunset, depending on the observer's latitude and on the positions of Venus and the Sun. Most of the time, it can
		be seen either in the morning or in the evening. At some times, it may even be seen a while in a completely dark
		sky. Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days.It has a synodic day length of 117 Earth days and a sidereal
		rotation period of 243 Earth days. Consequently, it takes longer to rotate about its axis than any other planet
		in the Solar System, and does so in the opposite direction to all but Uranus. This means that the Sun rises from
		its western horizon and sets in its east.Venus does not have any moons, a distinction it shares only with
		Mercury among the planets in the Solar System.</p>

		The third smallest planet in the Solar System, Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's
		"sister planet" because of their similar size, mass, proximity to the Sun, and bulk composition. It is radically
		different from Earth in other respects. It has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets,
		consisting of more than 96% carbon dioxide. The atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface is about 92 times
		the sea level pressure of Earth, or roughly the pressure at 900 m (3,000 ft) underwater on Earth. Even though
		Mercury is closer to the Sun, Venus has the hottest surface of any planet in the Solar System, with a mean
		temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F). Venus is shrouded by an opaque layer of highly reflective clouds of
		sulfuric acid, preventing its surface from being seen from space in light. It may have had water oceans in the
		past,[23][24] but these would have vaporized as the temperature rose under a runaway greenhouse effect.[25] The
		water has probably photodissociated, and the free hydrogen has been swept into interplanetary space by the solar
		wind because of the lack of a planetary magnetic field.[26] Because of the lethal surface conditions, the planet
		is sometimes referred to as Earth's "evil twin".

		As one of the brightest objects in the sky, Venus has been a major fixture in human culture for as long as
		records have existed. It has been made sacred to gods of many cultures and has been a prime inspiration for
		writers and poets as the "morning star" and "evening star". Venus was the first planet to have its motions
		plotted across the sky, as early as the second millennium BCE.[28]

		Its proximity to Earth has made Venus a prime target for early interplanetary exploration. It was the first
		planet beyond Earth visited by a spacecraft (Venera 1 in 1961) and the first to be successfully landed on (by
		Venera 7 in 1970). The planet's thick clouds render observation of its surface impossible in the visible
		spectrum, and the first detailed maps did not emerge until the arrival of the Magellan orbiter in 1991. Plans
		have been proposed for rovers or more complex missions, but they are hindered by Venus's hostile surface
		conditions. The possibility of life on Venus has long been a topic of speculation; in recent years, the topic
		has received active research.
